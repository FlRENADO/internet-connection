I made the `internet.sh` and the `beep.sh` scripts so that they beep the internal bios buzzer
thought that this was a better idea for some instances like if the script is running on a server
servers dont useually have sound system installed to them and just connecting it to one for beep sounds
so yeah thats the insperation
